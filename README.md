Grails queuekit plugin test site
============

### Running on grails 3

Plugin found here: https://github.com/vahidhedayati/grails-queuekit-plugin/

I should point out in this demo project the view/layouts/main.gsp has been altered the javascript tag is declard at the top:<br/>
    &lt;asset:stylesheet src="application.css"/&gt;<br/>
    &lt;asset:javascript src="application.js"/&gt;<br/>
    &lt;g:layoutHead/&gt;<br/>

## This test site combines queuekit plugin with:

    # Grails spring security plugin -
    This is then wired in with queuekit plugin through MyUserService which is injected back in
    grails-app/init/test/queuekit3/Application.groovy

    # Grails export plugin
    Three additional domainClasses TestExport, TestAddress, TestAttributes created in this demo site.
    Each domain class has had views/controllers generated by grails, the index action has been amended to use the
    queuekit plugin to run the export service from Grails export plugin.
